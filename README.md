# SpringBoot JPA Rest Crud API

This Mini Project aims to create a RESTful CRUD API using Spring Boot and JPA for managing employees data.

Scope: The project covers basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employee entities. It also includes functionalities like retrieving all employees, searching employees by ID, and potentially filtering employees based on age or city.

Technologies: The project utilizes Java 8 or higher, Spring Boot framework with dependencies like spring-web and spring-data-jpa, and likely a relational database like MySQL.

Tools: The project might have been developed using tools like Maven for project management, Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA for development, and Postman for API testing.

Framework: Using Spring Boot provides a robust and efficient foundation for building the API, leveraging its features like dependency injection and auto-configuration.

JPA: JPA simplifies database interactions, reducing boilerplate code and improving maintainability.
